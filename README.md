# Makers Academy - Battle in the browser challenge (Week 3)

In week 3 of Makers Academy we were tasked with making a simple 2 player turn-based browser game using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern.  
I used Sinatra to handle routing, Ruby for game logic and Capybara to automate browser tasks for full feature testing with RSpec.

Instructions for use:
- Clone this repo
- Run ```bundle``` to install dependencies
- Run ```rspec``` to view tests
- Run ```rackup``` to start server
- In your browser, navigate to http://localhost:9292
- Fight!


Currently Player 1 will always win! If I were to add to this project, I would introduce randomisation on damage and special/defensive moves. The project could also do with a lick of styling.
